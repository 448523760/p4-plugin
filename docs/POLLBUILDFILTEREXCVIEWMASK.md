# Exclude Changes Outside View Mask
Changes can be filtered to not trigger a build if none of the files within a change are contained in the view mask. 
![Exclude Changes Outside View Mask](images/pollbuildfilterexcviewmask.png)

**For example, with a view mask filter of:**  
`//depot/main/tests`  
`-//depot/main/tests/001`
- The change below is not filtered for the files below because `index.xml` is in the view mask:
   `//depot/main/tests/index.xml`   
   `//depot/main/tests/001/test.xml`   
- The change below is not filtered for the files below because `index.xml` is in the view mask:
   `//depot/main/test/index.xml`   
   `//depot/main/src/build.xml`   
- The change below is filtered because `build.xml` is not in the view mask:
   `//depot/main/src/build.xml`   
- The change below is filtered because no file is in the view mask:
   `//depot/main/src/build.xml`   
   `//depot/main/tests/001/test.xml`
