	<b>Populate Options</b>
	<p>Perforce will populate the workspace with the file revisions
		needed for the build. The different options effect the way the
		workspace is cleaned and the file revisions are updated.</p>
	<p>There are three options:</p>
	<ul>
		<dt>Automatic Cleanup and Sync</dt>
		<dd>
			Efficient cleaning and syncing of file revisions. Extra (non
			versioned files) are removed, missing and modified files re-added. </br>Best
			for clean builds.
		</dd>

		<dt>Force Clean and Sync</dt>
		<dd>Will remove all files from under the workspace root, then
			force sync the required files. Inefficient and NOT RECOMENDED.</dd>

		<dt>Sync Only</dt>
		<dd>
			No cleanup attempted; the sync will update all files (as CLOBBER is
			set) to the required set of revisions. </br>Best for incremental builds.
		</dd>
	</ul>
