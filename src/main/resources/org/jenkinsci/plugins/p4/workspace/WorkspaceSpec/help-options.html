	<p>Flags to configure the client behavior.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>ALLWRITE</b>
			<p>Leaves all files writable on the client;
				by default, only files opened by 'p4 edit'
				are writable. If set, files might be clobbered
				as a result of ignoring the clobber option
				(see below).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>CLOBBER</b>
			<p>Permits 'p4 sync' to overwrite writable
				files on the client.  noclobber is ignored if
				allwrite is set.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>COMPRESS</b>
			<p>Compresses data sent between the client
				and server to speed up slow connections.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>LOCKED</b>
			<p>Allows only the client owner to use or change
				the client spec.  Prevents the client spec from
				being deleted or unloaded.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>MODTIME</b>
			<p>Causes 'p4 sync' and 'p4 submit' to preserve
				file modification time, as with files with the
				+m type modifier. (See 'p4 help filetypes'.)
				With nomodtime, file timestamps are updated by
				sync and submit operations.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>RMDIR</b>
			<p>Makes 'p4 sync' attempt to delete a workspace
				directory when all files in it are removed.</p>
		</li>
