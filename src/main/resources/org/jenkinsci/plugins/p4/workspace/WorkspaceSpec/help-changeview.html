<div>
	<b>Change View</b>
	<p>Lines to restrict depot files to specific changelists.</p>
	<p>Restricts depot paths to a particular point in time.
		Example: //depot/path/...@1000
		Revisions submitted to the path after the specified
		changelist will not be visible.  Files matching a
		ChangeView path may not be submitted.

		Automatic labels may also used to specify a particular
		point in time: the label's 'Revision' field must be set
		to a changelist number or a date.  If the label has a
		view, only files that match the intersection of the
		ChangeViewpath and the label's view will be restricted to
		the point in time specified by the 'Revision' field; any
		other files matching the ChangeView path may sync to
		#head, but cannot be submitted.</p>
