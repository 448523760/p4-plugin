	<b>Depot path to a Client workspace Spec</b>
	<p>The specified client workspace spec will be used to configure
		the workspace and must match the name of the chosen workspace. If
		connected to a Perforce Server the auto fill will assist navigation to
		the depot file or spec depot. Revision numbers can be applied using
		Perforce's '#' notation.</p>
	<p>For example: //spec/clients/jenkins-test-ws.p4s#3</p>
