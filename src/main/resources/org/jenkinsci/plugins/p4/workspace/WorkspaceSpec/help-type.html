	<b>Type</b>
	<p>Type of client: writeable/readonly/partitioned/graph</p>
	<p>By default all clients are 'writeable', certain clients
		are short lived and perform long sync and build cycles.
		Over time these build clients can fragment the 'db.have'
		table which is used to track what files a client has
		synced.  Setting a type of 'readonly' gives the client
		its own personal 'db.have' database table.  A 'readonly'
		client cannot 'edit' or 'submit' files, however for build
		automation this is not usually a requirement and the
		performance tradeoff is worth considering if your build
		automation is causing issues with the 'db.have' table.
		This option requires that an administrator has first
		configured the 'client.readonly.dir' setting.  If it is
		necessary to submit changes as part of your build,
		you may specify a 'partitioned' client: like a 'reaonly'
		client, this type also has a separate 'db.have' table
		under the 'client.readonly.dir' directory, but allows
		journalled 'edit' and 'submit' of files.</p>
