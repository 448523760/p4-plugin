	<b>An existing workspace</b>
	<p>Specify the name of the Perforce workspace to be used as the
		Jenkins build workspace. If the workspace does not yet exist, the
		configuration will be saved in Jenkins; the workspace is created only
		when it is to be used. If the workspace exists and you are connected
		to a Perforce server the auto-text fill should list suitable
		workspaces; updates are only applied when the workspace is used.</p>
